Cachesim.java is an cache simulator which reads trace files consisting of Load and store instructions.
The cache sim has implemented direct, fully associative, two-way and four-way associative cache.

The memtrace file should be in format:
  Instruction_Type Offset_In_Decimal MemoryAddress_In_Hex
  Example:
    LW 200 4cca98201
    SW -100 ffa983f00
  The offset in each line indicates that the decimal amount that needs to be added/subtracted(when negative) to the Memory address 
  after converting the hex to integer.

The output will print:
  miss rate
  hit rate
  # of sets
  # of ways
  # of tag bits
  # of index bits
  # of offset bits
